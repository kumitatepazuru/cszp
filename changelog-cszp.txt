var 5.0.0:
Modification place:
    Solved the problem of cszp dying when there is some problem with soccerwindow2. poking at the soccerwindow2 bug won't cause any problems with cszp!
    The ascii art of cszp was changed from figlet to pyfiglet. This makes it possible to run on other linux systems than debian. (Maybe you can run it on windows too...?)
    Running the soccer just got so much simpler! For those of you who thought it was hard to run in multiple windows! It's much easier to use!
Additional elements:
    It is now possible to configure whether to start the server. Yay!
    We've implemented a round-robin game. (beta) This isn't a dream come true for the officials to use...?

    cszp one year anniversary! (A little early) Yay! Thank you all so much! I'll keep up the good work!

var 4.5.0:
Modification place:
    Rewrite the cszp_soccer.py file to use the prompt toolkit for everything else, as cuitools has been updated.
    Using the prompt toolkit, the start, test, and loop commands executed in cszp_soccer.py can now be mouse-clicked in most cases. We also changed to the button interactive execution method.
    The previous user input function cuitools.Input has been replaced by the internal program cszp_module.Input to allow up and down history checking. (history from program execution) Also, you can use the input aid function in some areas, so you can enter commands easily.
    Removed cszp_html.py.
    When checking the server in loop mode, html.csv and so on are now passed in memory instead of being returned and accessed. Also, the load screen is now displayed on import.
    Remove cszp_log.kekka function. This eliminates the need to create data.csv and prevents it from being created.
    The log is now displayed correctly.
    The progress bar creation library tqdm is no longer used. Instead, we developed a time remaining display system that uses our own algorithm.
    Removed automake feature. It remains in the setting command, but does not work. Will be removed in a future update.
    The loop, start, and test commands have the same execution parts.
    We have strengthened our error monitoring system during matches.
